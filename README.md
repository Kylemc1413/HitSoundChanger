HitSoundChanger is a mod for Beat Saber that allows you to change the default sounds of beat saber.
This mod doesn't allow you to change the menu music or level failed sounds only the hit sounds and the bad hit sounds.  
If you want to change that, check out [DiSounds](https://github.com/Auros/DiSounds) but at this time, this mod isn't updated for the latest versions of the game.

## Installation

Go to the [releases](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and download the latest HitSoundChanger.zip
Extract it to your Beat Saber folder and launch your game.

## Usage
A great video tutorial can be found [here by DarkSwitchPro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oaQYYWZYwI)
1. Once the mod is installed and you've opened the game at least once, go to your Beat Saber Directory then the UserData folder.
2. Open the HitSoundChanger folder 
3. Create a new folder using the name of your choice. This will show up in game.
4. In this newly created folder, drag and drop the hit sound of your choice and name it exactly: 
>HitSound.ogg

If you also want to change the bad hit sound, drag and drop that into your folder and call it:
> BadHitSound.ogg

**NOTE: Your sound files MUST be in the ogg file format. If they're not it won't work**  
You can convert any other sound file to the .ogg format by using a website such as [this one](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg) which will convert any .mp3 file to .ogg  

## Trouble Shooting
Double check that the HitSoundChanger.dll is in your plugins folder.  
Make sure your game version is supported in the releases.  
If the mod is still not working, create a new issue, include the issue you are facing and your _latest.log file that is located in your Beat Saber directory then the "logs" folder.  
Pirated versions of the game aren't supported and no support will be provided.
